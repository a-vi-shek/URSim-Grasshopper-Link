# Offline simulation of Universal Robots and testing with Rhino-Grasshopper

![URSim Grasshopper Link](/images/01_header.png)

[URSim](https://www.universal-robots.com/download/?option=71470#section16597) is a offline simulator for Universal Robots for offline programming and simulation for robot programs and manual jogging of robots with **limited capacities**.

It also can be combined with Rhino-Grasshopper with [Robots](https://github.com/visose/Robots) to test robot codes for Universal robots _with the **limitations** mentioned earlier_. One can simulate the code, read positions, set digital outputs among many other things from Grasshopper. This project/method was very useful to test various robot codes during the recent lockdown situation without having access to a physical robot.

This method is built upon this [guide](https://academy.universal-robots.com/media/jiehhszc/ursim_vmoracle_installation_guidev03_en.pdf).

## Steps

* Install Oracle VMware
* Download preferred URSim Version
* Install URSim
* Configure VMWare to connect with Windows
